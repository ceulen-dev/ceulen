// ponytail: vendored from @bacnh85/pi-model-tools 0.9.5 — lib/bash-auto-bg.ts
// Local changes: (1) the PI_MODEL_TOOLS_BASH_AUTO_BG[_SECS] env readers are
// dropped — enable/threshold now come from the `repair` settings section
// (lib/settings.ts) and are bound once at module load; (2) the follow-up
// customType and the tmp log prefix take the ceulen- namespace
// (`ceulen-repair-bg`) per the bundle's customType convention.
/**
 * bash-auto-bg.ts — auto-background long foreground bash commands.
 *
 * OMP 18.2.8 parity ("background job notifications … discourage unnecessary
 * polling"): a foreground bash call still running at the threshold returns a
 * receipt immediately; when the job settles, its output is delivered as a
 * follow-up turn via pi.sendMessage({deliverAs: "followUp", triggerTurn: true})
 * — the wake-up mechanism subagent already proved. The prompt-only half
 * (anti-poll clause) lives in bashAutoBgClause(); both halves ship together so
 * the description text and the mechanism can never drift apart.
 *
 * The caller-supplied `timeout` (seconds) is passed through untouched: the
 * underlying local operations enforce it as a total-runtime kill, so a
 * backgrounded job still dies at its deadline without a second timer here.
