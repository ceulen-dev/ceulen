// (extensions/lib/guidance.ts). Local change: the env-toggle helpers
// (selectionGuidanceEnabled, strictSerenaEnabled, firstToolHintsDisabled,
// superPowerModeEnabled, superPowerPromptContent) are dropped — every one is a
// row in the `steering` settings section now (lib/settings.ts), read per turn.
// superPowerPrompt(custom) takes the custom prompt as an argument instead of
// reading PI_MODEL_TOOLS_CUSTOM_SUPERPOWER_PROMPT.
