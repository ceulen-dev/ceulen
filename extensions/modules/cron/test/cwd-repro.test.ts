/**
 * Regression: wrong-cwd delivery of unpinned cron fires.
 *
 * Bug (fixed in fire()): jobs.json is global to the agent dir. Any open pi
 * session sharing the agent dir runs the 30s tickOnce() scheduler, and
 * whichever session ticks first fires the job — including a session whose cwd
 * differs from job.cwd. Unpinned fires were delivered as follow-up turns into
 * THAT session (deliverFire → sendMessage), so the prompt ran under the wrong
 * cwd. job.cwd was only honored by runHeadless (pinned jobs) and `export`.
 *
 * Driven at the seam where the fix landed: the real extension's fire()
 * closure, reached via the cron tool's execute() with a foreign-session cwd.
 * Both the ctx.cwd passed here AND process.cwd() point at the foreign session
 * (pi's session cwd is process.cwd()). The scheduler tick routes through the
 * same fire() closure, so pinning execute() pins both paths.
